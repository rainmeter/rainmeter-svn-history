      <DIV align=left><!-- CLIP -->Rainmeter is a customizable resource meter 
      that can display various performance data in different formats. Rainmeter 
      can measure: 
      <UL>
        <LI>CPU load 
        <LI>Allocated Memory 
        <LI>Network Traffic 
        <LI>NT performance data 
        <LI>Uptime 
        <LI>Free disk space 
        <LI>...and plenty of other stuff </LI></UL>
      <P>The data can be displayed e.g. in a histogram, a bar, bitmap frames or 
      just plain numbers. Rainmeter also includes a plugin interface which means 
      that the feature set can be extented with 3rd party plugins.</P>
      <P>Windows 2000 or newer is required to run Rainmeter. It does not work in 
      Win95, Win98 or WinME.</P>
      <P>And no, Rainmeter does not measure how much it rained last night 
      (though it probably could ;-) <!-- CLIP --></P></DIV></TD>

      <P><B>IMPORTANT</B>: Rainmeter uses gdi+, so unless you are running 
      WindowsXP you need to download the gdiplus.dll from <A 
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6a63ab9c-df12-4d41-933c-be590feaa05a&amp;DisplayLang=en">here</A> 
      (just put the dll into the same folder where Rainmeter is or into 
      Litestep's folder if you're not running Rainmeter as standalone).</P>
      <P><I><B><FONT size=4>Installing for Explorer</FONT></B></I></P>
      <P>Get the installer version of Rainmeter from <A 
      href="http://www.rainmeter.net">http://www.rainmeter.net</A>) and run it. 
      If you dislike installers, you can also get the zipped archive and 
      uncompress it to some folder. Rainmeter is ready to be used after that. 
      Note that if you want that Rainmeter starts with the Windows you need to 
      keep the "Startup folder"-option checked in the installation.</P>
      <P><I><B><FONT size=4>Installing for Litestep</FONT></B></I> </P>
      <P>To install just copy everything from the zip-file to a 
      <I>Rainmeter</I>-subfolder in your Litestep-folder (i.e. wherever 
      $litestepdir$ variable points to. Usually <EM>C:\Litestep\</EM>). You 
      don't need the <I>Rainmeter.exe</I> if you are using Rainmeter as Litestep 
      plugin, but there is no harm keeping that also in the folder. </P>
      <P>After copying, open your step.rc and add following line:</P>
      <P><FONT face="Courier New">LoadModule 
      $litestepdir$Rainmeter\Rainmeter.dll</FONT></P>
      <P>... and recycle. Most of the configuration of Rainmeter is done in a 
      <I>Rainmeter.ini</I> file and not in the step.rc. Check the 
      Settings-section for details.</P>
      <P><I><B><FONT size=4>Uninstalling</FONT></B></I></P>
      <P>If you installed Rainmeter with the installer you can uninstall it from 
      the "Add or Remove Programs". Otherwise just delete all the files you 
      uncompressed from the zip-file (make sure that Rainmeter isn't running 
      when doing that). <!-- CLIP --></P></DIV></TD>

      <P>There isn't any fancy settings editor, so you need to change the 
      settings with your favorite text editor. The settings for Rainmeter are 
      scattered to several places, but for most of you the <I>Rainmeter.ini</I> 
      is the only place you need to make changes. The general configuration 
      settings are in a <I>Rainmeter.ini</I>-file. The skin settings are in the 
      skin's ini-files. The Litestep's step.rc only has few optional entries, 
      which can be used to define the paths and select the skin. </P>
      <P><FONT size=4><B>Step.rc</B></FONT></P>
      <P><B>RainmeterIniFile</B> <BR>This can be set to point to the 
      Rainmeter.ini file if it is not placed in the default place (i.e. in the 
      Rainmeter.dll's folder). </P>
      <P><B>RainmeterSkinPath<BR></B>This defines the path where the skins are. 
      The skins must be in separate subfolders under the given folder.</P>
      <P><B>RainmeterCurrentConfig</B> <BR>The name of current config. This can 
      be used to force the use of some config. You must also define 
      RainmeterCurrentConfigIni.</P>
      <P><B>RainmeterCurrentConfigIni</B><BR>The name of current config ini-file 
      (only the ini-file, not the path!).</P>

      <P>The file has two main sections [Rainmeter] and [Statistics]. The 
      Rainmeter section contains general settings that can be used to change how 
      Rainmeter behaves. The settings are used as default values for all new 
      configs that are opened. Once the config is opened it will write the 
      settings under its own sertion in the Rainmeter.ini file.&nbsp; The 
      Statistics section contains some things that few measures store in there. 
      Do not modify them by hand. </P>
      <P>One special section is [TrayMeasure], which can be used to define a 
      measure for the tray icon. You can use any measure for this as long as it 
      returns some meaningful values (i.e. numbers between some limits).</P>
      <P>These must be put under [Rainmeter]-section (or under the different 
      config sections):</P>
      <P><B>WindowX<BR></B>X-position of the meter window. Negative values can 
      be used too, in which case the position is relative to right edge of the 
      screen. If Rainmeter is ran inside a lsbox the window position should be 
      set to 0.</P>
      <P><B>WindowY<BR></B>Y-position of the meter window. Negative values can 
      be used too, in which case the position is relative to bottom edge of the 
      screen.</P>
      <P><B>AllowNegativeCoordinates<BR></B>If set to 1, the negative 
      coordinates are interpret as negative. If set to 0, they define offset 
      from the bottom right corner of the desktop (like most Litestep modules 
      do).</P>
      <P><B>SavePosition<BR></B>If set to 1, the position of the window is 
      stored in the Rainmeter.ini file so that it'll be remembered when 
      Rainmeter is executed the next time.</P>
      <P><B>AlwaysOnTop<BR></B>If set to 1, the window is always on top of other 
      windows. If 0, the window positioning is normal. If set to -1 the window 
      stays back of the other windows. -2 pins the window to desktop and 2 keeps 
      the window on top of other topmost windows. Note that -2 (OnDesktop) only 
      works with Explorer-shell.</P>
      <P><B>Draggable<BR></B>If set to 1, the window can be dragged around with 
      the mouse. If 0, the window stationary.</P>
      <P><B>SnapEdges<BR></B>If set to 1, the window will snap to screen edges 
      when moved.</P>
      <P><B>HideOnMouseOver<BR></B>If set to 1 the meter window will disappear 
      if the mouse pointer is moved on it. The window will reappear when the 
      mouse pointer is moved off the position where the window was. If shift, 
      ctrl or alt is hold while moving the mouse, the window will not disappear 
      (or reappear).</P>
      <P><B>StartHidden<BR></B>If set to 1, Rainmeter is hidden when started. 
      You can use !RainmeterShow-bang to make it visible.</P>
      <P><B>NativeTransparency<BR></B>Set to 1 for native transparency support 
      (only for Win2k &amp; XP).</P>
      <P><B>AlphaValue<BR></B>The transparency value for the window. Use values 
      between 0...255. Only works if native transparency is enabled.</P>
      <P><B>ClickThrough<BR></B>If set to 1 the mouse clicks go through the 
      window. Only works if native transparency is enabled.</P>
      <P><B>LeftMouseDownAction<BR></B>Command or a bang that will be executed 
      when the left mouse button is pressed down over the Rainmeter's window. 
      Note that this disables the dragging.</P>
      <P><B>RightMouseDownAction<BR></B>Command or a bang that will be executed 
      when the right mouse button is pressed down over the Rainmeter's 
      window.</P>
      <P><B>LeftMouseUpAction<BR></B>Command or a bang that will be executed

      the mouse leaves the Rainmeter's window.</P>
      <P><B>DesktopWorkArea</B><BR>Sets a new work area for the desktop. The 
      workarea defines the maximized windows cover. Use four comma separated 
      values (e.g. DesktopWorkArea=0,0,1500,1200). Note that moving the taskbar 
      will reset the workarea to Windows' default (changing screen resolution 
      will do the same).</P>
      <P><B>TrayIcon</B><BR>Set to 0 to get rid of the tray icon.</P>
      <P><B>FadeDuration</B><BR>This defines the amount of time it takes to fade 
      the window. The time is in milliseconds. To get rid of the fading set the

      <P>The skins are placed into the Skins-folder. Each skin must be in it's 
      own subfolder. The actual skin-file is a normal ini-file with several 
      sections that define the skin's shape and the things it&nbsp; measures and 
      displays. The skin's subfolder can contain several ini-files, but only one 
      of them can be active at the same time. This allows you to for example 
      supply localized skins or different variations of some skin.</P>
      <P><B>Important: </B>Do not use spaces in the name of the folder or the 
      ini-files.</P>
      <P>The skin's ini-file is divided into four parts. All the general 
      settings are put under [Rainmeter] section and the variables in 
      [Variables]-section. After the general stuff comes the measures, which do 
      the actual measuring of values. After the measures comes meters, which are 
      visual representations of the measures. It is possible to bind many meters 
      for one measure. It's not necessary to put the sections to this order but 
      it might make the configs better organized.</P>
      <P>The variables are keywords that are replaced in other settings. These 
      can be used e.g. to gather user defined values to the top of the 
      config-file so that they can be easily changed. To use a variable just 
      surround the keyword with '#'-chars.</P>
      <P>These must be put under [Rainmeter] section.</P>
      <P><B>Background<BR></B>Name of the background image. If this is omitted a 
      copy of the desktop is taken and used as the background for the meters. 
      Pink color (255, 0, 255) can be used as transparent color. You can use 
      BMPs, JPGs and PNGs (with alpha channel!)</P>
      <P><B>BackgroundMode<BR></B>Defines the background mode: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>0 = Image as defined by <B>Background</B> 
        <LI>1 = Transparent 
        <LI>2 = Solid color 
        <LI>3 = Scaled background image </LI></UL>
      <P><B>BackgroundMargins</B><BR>Defines the margins for the background 
      image that are not scaled when the BackgroundMode is set to 3. E.g. 
      BackgroundMargins=10,10,10,10</P>
      <P><B>SolidColor<BR></B>If the background mode is set to 2, this defines 
      the color of the background. </P>
      <P><B>SolidColor2</B><BR>If the background mode is set to 2, this defines 
      the second color of the background for gradient. </P>
      <P><B>GradientAngle<BR></B>If the background mode is set to 2, this 
      defines the angle for the color gradient. The angle is defined as 
      radians.</P>
      <P><B>BevelType<BR></B>This draws a bevel edge around the solid 
      background. 0 = no bevel, 1 = raised, 2 = sunken.</P>
      <P><B>Update<BR></B>The update time for the meters. The value should be 
      given in milliseconds. The default value is 1000 (i.e. one second).</P>
      <P><B>DynamicWindowSize</B><BR>If set to 1 the size of the window is 
      calculated during every update. The window is scaled automatically if 
      necessary.</P>
      <P><B>DragMargins</B><BR>Defines the area from where the window can be 
      dragged. You need to define 4 values separated with comma. The values 
      define the margin of non-draggable area. It's also possible to use 
      negative numbers in which case the margin is calculated from the opposite 
      side. E.g. DragMargins=0, -100, 0, 0 </P>
      <P><B>KeepOnScreen</B><BR>Set to 1 to keep the windows always on the 
      monitor area.</P>
      <P><B>Author<BR></B>The name and email of the author of the skin. The 
      string is displayed in the about dialog.</P>
      <P><B>AppVersion<BR></B>The minimum version or Rainmeter that is needed by 
      this skin. It is not necessary to define this if you don't want to. The 
      version is a single number that can be calculated like this: Major * 1000 
      + Minor. E.g. a value for Rainmeter 0.11.4 would be 11004.

      <P>The <I>Initialize</I> function is called when the measure is 
      initialized. The function returns the maximum value that can be measured. 
      If the maximum value is unknown the function should return 0. The plugin 
      can also have it's own settings which can be loaded from the iniFile and 
      the section given as parameters to the initialize function. the 
      id-parameter is used to identify individual measures if there are several 
      of them using the same plugin.</P>
      <P>The<I> Finalize</I> is called when the measure is deleted. </P>
      <P>The <I>Update</I> is called once per update period (usually once per 
      second). The function returns the measured value. The <I>Update2</I> is an 
      alternative version of the function which can be used if the measure 
      returns negative values.</P>
      <P>The <I>GetString</I> is called when the meter needs the value as 
      string. If this function is not implemented the value returned by the 
      <I>Update</I> is converted to a string automatically.</P>

      <P>WebParser reads information from webpages. The plugin uses <A 
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular 
      expressions</A> to parse the web page which allows it to extract 
      information pretty much from any page. The plugin can be used e.g. to get 
      the current TV shows, weather conditions, stock exchange values, news and 
      basically anything that is on the net. The negative side is that the 
      regular expressions might look rather complex especially if you're not 
      familiar with programming languages.</P>
      <P><B>Url<BR></B>Url to the file to be downloaded and parsed. The Url can 
      also be another WebParser-measure, in which case the already downloaded 
      and parsed information can be reused (e.g. when displaying different 
      StringIndex on the same page). To do this just give the name of the 
      measure in the Url, like this: Url=[MeasureSlashDot]</P>
      <P><B>RegExp<BR></B>The regular expression used in parsing. The plugin 
      uses <A href="http://www.pcre.org">Perl Compatible Regular 
      Expressions</A>, so check the <A 
      href="http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlre.html">Perl docs</A> 
      for syntax and more info.</P>
      <P><B>FinishAction<BR></B>Action that is executed when the page has been 
      downloaded and the parsing is done.</P>
      <P><B>StringIndex<BR></B>Defines which string from the regexp this measure 
      returns. You can get the correct index values by setting the Debug=1, 
      which will add all matched strings to the log-file.</P>
      <P><B>UpdateRate<BR></B>The rate how often the webpage is downloaded. This 
      is relative to the config's main update rate. It is advisable to limit the 
      rate so that you're not flooding the server with constant requests. The 
      web server admins will not like it and you probably get banned from the 
      server altogether if you try to poll the server too often. So, if the main 
      update rate is 1000 (i.e. one second, which is the default) set this e.g. 
      to 60 to read the webpage once per minute.</P>
      <P><B>Debug<BR></B>Set this to 1 and the log file will contain some useful 
      debug information. Value 2 dumps the downloaded webpage to 
      C:\WebParserDump.txt. This can be useful since some web servers send 
      different information depending which client requests it. Remember to 
      remove this from your config once you have it working correctly.</P>
      <P><B>Download<BR></B>If set to 1, the <B>Url</B> is downloaded to a 
      temporary folder and the name to the file is returned as string value. The 
      measure can be bound to a IMAGE meter to download images from web and show 
      them. If the RegExp is defined the parsed string is interpreted as a link 
      to the downloaded image.</P>

		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        <LI>Moved the Update setting from Rainmeter.ini to the skin's ini-file 
        so that skin can determine it's update speed. 
        <LI>AverageSize can be used to measures an average value (the parameter 
        is the value window size) 
        <LI>UpdateDivider works for meters too. 
        <LI>If the image meter is bound to a measure it tries to load the image 
        named after the value (that is returned as string).
